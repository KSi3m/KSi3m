  <summary> <h2>Infinite Rush üéÆ </h2></summary>
 
  Tech stack:   ![Udemy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udemy-A435F0?logo=udemy&logoColor=fff) ![C#](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/C%23-%23239120.svg?logo=cshrp&logoColor=white)
 
  A platform game inspired by the endless runner genre, developed as a project for the Game Programming course at UMCS. I worked on:
  
  - Sound and graphic design.
  - Implementation of the sound system.
  - Developing key functionalities for the main character, including movement and the health system.
  
  In the game, players navigate through an infinite journey, battling enemies, collecting power-ups, and aiming to survive as long as possible while achieving high scores. **You can see the gameplay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhftZUFf5Ew "here")!**
  
  Game developed with [Pawe≈Ç](https://github.com/RedRabel99 "Pawe≈Ç") and [Szymon](https://github.com/oreze "Szymon").

## üå± My future goals:
My goal is to become quite good in what I do and, in a few years, be in a position to share my knowledge and experiences with those who are just starting their journey in the tech field. I've met a lot of people in my life who helped me with all sorts of things, and I see it as a way of showing them my gratitude.

Apart from the obvious (that being expanding my .NET skillset), I'm interested in learning **Q#**, the language for quantum programming, a topic that is dear to me. I also would love to deepen my understanding of machine learning, particularly in the context of sound manipulation, such as extracting instruments from songs, isolating vocals in low-quality recordings, and other audio processing techniques. 

## ü§ù Volunteering

I'm a member of a reenactment group. And although I don't wear a uniform or participate in reenactments, I contribute to the "internet front" by managing the group's website (created by me) and supporting its online presence.
